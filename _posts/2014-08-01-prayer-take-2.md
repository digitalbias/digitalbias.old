In his April 2014 conference address titled, "The Priesthood Man", President Eyring suggested praying each day, talking to God "specifically [about] who has blessed your life and how during that day." He also suggested thanking God for his kindness, and to "think of others, by name, who need your kindness."

The Bible Dictionary section on prayer says,

> "As soon as we learn the true relationship in which we stand toward God (namely, God is our Father, and we are His children), then at once prayer becomes natural and instinctive on our part (Matt. 7:7â€“11). Many of the so-called difficulties about prayer arise from forgetting this relationship. Prayer is the act by which the will of the Father and the will of the child are brought into correspondence with each other. The object of prayer is not to change the will of God but to secure for ourselves and for others blessings that God is already willing to grant but that are made conditional on our asking for them. Blessings require some work or effort on our part before we can obtain them. Prayer is a form of work and is an appointed means for obtaining the highest of all blessings."

Lately, as I have thought about these things, I've wondered if my personal, family and public prayers couldn't use some improvement.

Too often, when I pray, I focus more on what is going to happen after the prayer than on who I am talking to and why. I focus on the details of the meeting about to start, the food before me on a Fast Sunday, or my nervousness in being in front of the congregation. All of these things distract me from what is really important: A conversation between the Lord and me.

Sometimes I think I use too many of the same phrases, and while I am sincere in my desires and conversation with the Lord, I wonder, "If the Lord were standing here with me, would I be praying as quickly, or be as distracted as I am right now?"

I know that those times when I learn to forget myself and the distractions around me and instead focus on the present and what I am doing, namely having a conversation with my Father in Heaven, the Creator of the Universe, I have had some of the sweetest experiences and my trust and reliance on the Lord has increased.

As President Eyring said, "Again, that experience will surprise you every day, and over time it will change you." May we all work toward that change every day, is my sincere wish.
