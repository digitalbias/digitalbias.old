Lately I have been thinking about the value of obedience and faith. Often in our lives we are asked to do things which we may not understand. Adam, was told to offer sacrifices to the Lord, without knowing before hand the reason for doing it. Abraham was asked to sacrifice Issac, not knowing beforehand what the Lord had in store for him atop the mountain. And many of the early saints were called upon to sacrifice homes, multiple times as they were driven from place to place until they settled in the Salt Lake Valley. 

None of these people knew why they were being called upon to sacrifice so much. None knew before hand what blessings were in store after the trial of their faith. Yet, in every case, after the trial of their faith, they were rewarded.

Now days, our sacrifices may not be as dramatic, but can still try our faith. Sometimes it may be serving in a calling while trying to juggle the many family and work responsibilities in order to provide for our families temporal and spiritual welfare. In other cases we may be called upon by somebody we are responsible to in order to lend our support to a cause we do not agree with. Finally, we may struggle with a particular commandment, teaching or pratice of the church.

In all these scenarios the Lord has promised us blessings as we heed His call. He has said:

> "And after their temptations, and much tribulation, behold, I, the Lord, will feel after them, and if they harden not their hearts, and stiffen not their necks against me, they shall be converted, and I will heal them." _(D&C 112:13)_

When I find myself in a situation where I am struggling, for one reason or another, I find comfort in those words and in the blessings the followers of Alma experienced as they were being oppressed by the Lamanites (Mosiah 24). During their afflictions and tribulations under the hands of the Lamenites, the Lord spoke to Alma and said: 

> "Lift up your heads and be of good comfort, for I know of the covenant which ye have made unto me; and I will covenant with my people and deliver them out of bondage. 

> "And I will also ease the burdens which are upon your shoulders, that even you cannot feel them upon your backs, even while you are in bondage; and this will I do that ye may stand as witnesses for me hereafter, and that ye may know of a surety that I, the Lord God, do visit my people in their afflictions." _(Mosiah 24:13-14)_

I find comfort and strength in knowing that the Lord will recognize the covenants I have made with Him and, if I trust in Him, he will ease my burdens. He may not take them away, but instead may increase my ability to bear those burdens.

May we trust in the Lord with all our heart; and lean not unto our own understanding, but in all our ways acknowledge him, that he may direct our paths. _(Proverbs 3:5-6)_
