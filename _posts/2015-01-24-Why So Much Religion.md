## Why so much religion here?

You may have noticed that almost all the posts here are religion related. I'm a member of the bishopric in my LDS ward and we have a monthly newsletter. Each member of the bishopric takes a turn writing an article for the newsletter so that forces me to dig down and think about what I believe and write something every three months. I don't usually publish what I write to most people, but since these articles are already "out in the wild" I figured that I'd just post them here as well.

Since then I've also gotten in the habit of just writing an article for my personal scripture study as a way of getting in the mode of writing in general. It's helped my dig deeper into the scriptures and helped me learn more about the Gospel.

I decided that since I was already writing I might as well share what I've learned (in some cases...you may note that there is no article for November).

## Writing

Having said that, I should also let you know that if you are aware of this blog, my wife and I are gearing up to publish articles on family organization and productivity. Hopefully people will find [the organized family](http://theorganizedfamily.org/) useful and decide there are things worth incorporating into their own family.

Finally, while this is what has forced me to get more into writing, I also have some fiction I have written as well. I've got three books in various stages of completion:

### Fiction

#### Chameria/Change Reaction

The concept came from high school. I wrote the first draft during nanowrimo 2003 and haven't touched it since. It could use _a lot_ of polish before it's ready for anything sort of saying 'I wrote it'.

**Synopsis**: A near-future science fiction story of a college student who  struggles to survive while big businesses attempt to find his fathers genetic and technical legacy. 

**Status**: Hiatus (bottom the the drawer). Needs a rewrite, cleanup and expanded scenes in some cases.

#### Champion

**Synopsis**: A fantasy novel about a young soldier whos world is turned upside down when he discovers his team is guilty of kidnapping the princess.

**Status**: Stuck. I decided to work on Riftwalker so I could let my hindbrain work out some of the tangles I've painted myself into. I'm also working on Riftwalker so I get a bit more idea of what my process is. Champion was dragging in a lot of places for a lot of reasons and I want to get back to it, but think I need to figure out what was going on with it before I continue with it.

#### Riftwalker

**Synopsis**: A science fiction-fantasy thriller about a young man who teams up with justice wielding dimension hoppers to rescue his brother's abducted newborn baby.

**Status**: Under development. I've written about 22K on this and expect it to be 75K. I have the general plot and character sheets done but need to get the character plot details from the sheets interleaved with the rest of the plot. Once that is done, I finish the outlining and be back to writing the prose instead of the outline. 

I found out about the [Snowflake Method](http://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/) and it makes a lot of sense to how I want to write and what seems to work for me. I started writing the scenes before I was done with the other steps (mistake), so I'm going back and doing the work I should have done in the first place. Very few changes should occur in the scenes I've written to date, however.

### Interest?

If you are interested in getting on the early reader list for any of these, let me know and I'll add you to the early reader list.
