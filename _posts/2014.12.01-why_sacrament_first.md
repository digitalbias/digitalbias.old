I have often wondered why it is that during sacrament meeting we take the sacrament first and then hear from the speakers messages about what we should do to live the gospel. Today I think I have my answer.

Jesus, when visiting the Nephites for the second time, came down and ministered to the multitude. He had them kneel on the ground and pray. As they did so, they were purified and filled with the Holy Ghost. Then they took the sacrament. Then Jesus taught them the things he had been commanded to teach them the day before. There is a pattern there. It is basically the same pattern we have when in scarament meeting.

One of the things the Holy Ghost does is help us understand. I think one of the reasons we are taught after having taken the sacrament is because we have just renewed our convenants with God and are thus entitled to inspiration and beng filled with a greater portion of the Holy Ghost. We can then better understand the messages given to us and better committ ourselves in the course of action we have been inspired to follow through the promptings of the Holy Ghost than we would have been if we had taken the sacrament after the messages.

I think the idea is that we would hear the message before the sacrament (like in the previous chapters in 3rd Nephi) before being given the gift of the Holy Ghost because we are being called upon to repent and join, but after being members, we are entitled to the Gift of the Holy Ghost and are already members, so we renew our covenants and are then taught how to better keep the covenants we have made instead of being called upon to make those covenants.

Anyway, just a thought and something I will continue to ponder and pray about, but it's a good start.
