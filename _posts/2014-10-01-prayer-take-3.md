In regional conference this September, Elder Scott shared a number of ideas on how to make our prayers more effective. I wish to share the following ideas I gleaned from his talk and which I have been trying to incorporate into my own prayers.

1. We can have a one-on-one with Heavenly Father. We should pray as if we were just talking to Him as if He were sitting right in front of us, face-to-face.
1. Share your deepest feelings with Him. Don't hold anything back. 
1. Quietly speaking words helps express deepest feelings. He shared a story about how he would pray with his companion on his mission, and then when his companion had fallen asleep, he would go off and pray quietly under his breath.
1. You are never too unworthy to pray.
1. Express gratitude all the time. It will engender many Christ-like attributes.

I'm not perfect in my prayers by any stretch of the imagination, yet I have found in the last couple months as I have tried to apply Elder Scott's teachings that my prayers are better on average. I know that as we "counsel with the Lord in all our doings" and do it with a sincere heart and humbly wait on Him, He guides us.

I am grateful for the counsel of prophets and apostles. They have today's news today and are more in touch with what we need than people give them credit for. I know that as we are obedient to the commandments the Lord blesses us. His mercy is right there for us, just waiting for us to lay hold of it.

May we all feel a greater sense of His love for us as we pray to Him with all our heart.
