The following is a quote from the Teaching of the Prophets: Spencer W. Kimball

> “I always have very tender feelings about prayers and the power and blessings of prayer,” said President Spencer W. Kimball. “In my lifetime I have received more blessings than I can ever adequately give thanks for. The Lord has been so good to me. I have had so many experiences in sickness and in health that leave me with no shadow of doubt in my heart and mind that there is a God in heaven, that he is our Father, and that he hears and answers our prayers.”

> “None of us should get so busy in our lives that we cannot contemplate with prayer.”

> One of these experiences came when President Kimball and his wife, Camilla, traveled to a conference in New Zealand. When they reached the city of Hamilton, they were so sick that President Kimball asked President N. Eldon Tanner, First Counselor in the First Presidency, to represent him at a cultural event planned for that evening. Some hours later, President Kimball “awakened with a start and asked Dr. Russell Nelson, who sat watching over him, ‘Brother Nelson, what time was that program to begin this evening?’

> “‘At seven o’clock, President Kimball.’

> “‘What time is it now?’

> “‘It is almost seven.’

> “Spencer was soaked with perspiration. His fever had broken. … He said, ‘Tell Sister Kimball we’re going.’

> “Camilla got out of bed, and they both hurriedly dressed and then drove the short distance to the stadium where the program had just convened. President Tanner had explained at the beginning of the meeting that they were too sick to attend. In the opening prayer a young New Zealander petitioned fervently, ‘We three thousand New Zealand youth have gathered here prepared to sing and to dance for thy prophet. Wilt thou heal him and deliver him here.’ As the prayer ended, the car carrying Spencer and Camilla entered and the stadium erupted in a spontaneous, deafening shout at the answer to their prayer.”

Stories like these inspire me and help me realize that one of the simplest and yet most powerful forms of worship is prayer. As I sometimes struggle to keep track of all the responsibilities in life, I know that by trusting in the Lord and counseling with Him that even if some of them drop, the Lord will help me when it comes time to pick them back up. I am thankful for the power of prayer and that we have a loving, understanding Heavenly Father who helps and comforts us in our times of struggle as well as in times of calm.
