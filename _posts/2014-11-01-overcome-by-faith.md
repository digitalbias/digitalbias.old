As a family we recently read section 76 of the Doctrine and Covenants. While reading about those who achieve the celestial glory, it says:

> And who overcome by faith, and are sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise, which the Father sheds forth upon all those who are just and true. (D&C 76:53)

As we read that, I began wondering, "What does it mean to 'overcome by faith'?" So, I began looking and reading and studying a little about what that phrase means and this is what I've learned.

To overcome by faith means that we deny ourselves the appetites of the flesh, and through the atonement of Christ and the power of the Holy Ghost we are filled with spiritual power and increased strength to deny ourselves greater and greater physical desires, until we become 'perfected in Christ.' We will not yield to temptations to lust after riches or to abuse power which is given to us.

Overcoming by faith means we yield our hearts to God and are willing to do anything He asks of us. (Heleman 3:35). We become single minded in our worship of God and instead become firm, steadfast and immovable in righteousness. It means we will focus on obeying all of Gods commandments and correct principles constantly and consistently.

It means we will engender without our hearts and create habits which will lead us away from temptations and sin and instead replace bad habits with those which will help us grow and increase in light, knowledge and love for God. Then, as those habits become a part of us, we will increase in these godly attributes and grow, line upon line, here a little and there a little until we are full of light and glory and have overcome the world through exercising our faith on a daily basis and are thus worthy of the celestial kingdom. How will we know? Because it will be obvious by just looking at us.
