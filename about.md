# Welcome

Welcome to the reboot. I had a blog for a long time. There were posts in there from before 2000. They're all gone now, sitting on a hard drive I have no inclination to spin up and retrieve the data from. In anycase, the data is there, if I should ever find the inclination to go and retreive it again, but this is the new system. It's based on [Jekyll][jekyll] and uses markup as the lingua franka from the posts. Simpler, not as heavy with scripting and backend databases. If needed it could be ported over to yet another system. 

Over the years I've used a number of systems. [WordPress][wp], [MovableType][mt], [Radio UserLand][radio], and [Blojsom][bloj] to name a few. Plain text files with markdown, run through a static site generation script is the name of the game for now.
