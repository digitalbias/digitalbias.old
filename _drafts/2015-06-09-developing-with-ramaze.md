# Developing a small site with Ramaze

I recently had a need to write a small web automation script and serve up the results in a web page. I didn't want something too heavy (Rails) but I also wanted a decent structure without having to code just about everything myself (Sinatra). Basically I was looking for something that was "Rails-lite": Rails without all the "junk in the trunk" as a friend of mine often says.

After a brief web search, I found [Ramaze][ramaze].


```ruby
def TheAwesomeClass 
    'Something here'
end
```
